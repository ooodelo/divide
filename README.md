# Face Divider

SketchUp extension that provides tools for subdividing planar faces with
parallel offsets or a rectangular grid. The project is structured in the
conventional SketchUp extension layout:

```
face_divider.rb      # Extension manifest and registration
face_divider/main.rb # Implementation of the tools
```

To install the extension, package the repository contents as an `.rbz` file
and load it through *Extensions → Install Extension…* inside SketchUp.
